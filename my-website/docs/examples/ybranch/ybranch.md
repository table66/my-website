# Y branch 

The insertion loss, transmission and S-parameters of a Y-branch are calculated using FDTD Solver.

# Overview 

The  y  branch is simulated using the EME solver to measure the power transmission , insertion losss and the S-parameters .


## step 1 :Initial simulation
Ensure the simulation is setup properly and explore the results.
