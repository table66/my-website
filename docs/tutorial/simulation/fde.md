# FDE

The Finite-Difference Eigenmode (FDE) solver calculates the spatial profile and frequency dependence of modes by solving Maxwell's equations on a cross-sectional mesh of the waveguide.  The solver calculates the mode field profiles, effective index, and loss.  Integrated frequency sweep makes it easy to calculate group delay, dispersion, etc.  The solver can also treat bent waveguides.
