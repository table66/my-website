# EME

## definition

The bidirectional eigenmode expansion (EME) solver is ideal for simulating light propagation over long distances. The computational cost of the method scales exceptionally well with the device length, making it much more efficient for the design and optimization of long tapers and periodic devices compared to FDTD-based methods.
